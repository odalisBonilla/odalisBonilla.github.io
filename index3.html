            <P> At a young age, Odalis was introduced to art by a man who would spend his time painting in the park.</P>
            <p> Her father would take her across the street to go visit the man in the park. this was great for the father </p>
            <p>and Odalis because the father saw the painter as a babysitter and while Odalis was there she learned to paint.</p>
            <p> However, this would only last for a year until Odalis needed to go back to the United States and start school.</p>
            <p> As Odalis grew older she would, later on, lose interest in art for a while until 8th grade. Many of her paintings</P>
            <p> are inspired by her family, her community, and mostly her dreams.</p>
